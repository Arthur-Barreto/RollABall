## About the Project

Space Odyssey is a game developed for the "Jogos Digitais" course at Insper. It is based on the **Roll a Ball** tutorial from Unity. In this game, players find themselves in the vast expanse of space, tasked with collecting all available resources within the map before the time runs out. Once all resources are collected, players must navigate to a black hole to complete the game successfully.
